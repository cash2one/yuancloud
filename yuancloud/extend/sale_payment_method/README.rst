Sale Payment Method
===================

It adds a payment method on the sales orders and allow to register
payments entries on sales orders.

This module is low level and works well with the following modules:
* **Sale Automatic Worflow** and **Sale Payment Method - Automatic Workflow**
  the payments created with this module will be automatically reconciled
  with the invoices of the sales orders.
* Sale Quick Payment: allows to create the payments with a button on the
  sales orders.

Also, the e-commerce connectors such as the **Magento Connector** or
**Prestashop Connector** use it to create the external payments.

Installation
============

Nothing special is required.

Configuration
=============

The payment methods can be configured in **Sales > Configuration >
Sales > Payment Methods**.

Usage
=====

A new field on sales orders allow to select the payment method used on
this sales order.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

 * It accepts only one method per sale order.

incoming products, and vendor bills all seamlessly in one place.</p><p >If you want to set up a vendor bill control process, the first thing you
need to do is to have purchase data in YuanCloud. Knowing what has been
purchased and received is the first step towards understanding your
purchase management processes.</p><p >yuancloud标准工作流程：</p><ol ><li >You begin with a <strong >Request for Quotation (RFQ)</strong> to send out to your
vendor(s).</li><li ><p >一旦供应商接受这询价单，确认这询价单为 <strong >采购订单(PO)</strong>。</p></li><li >Confirming the PO generates an <strong >Incoming Shipment</strong> if you purchased
any stockable products.</li><li >Upon receiving a <strong >Vendor Bill</strong> from your Vendor, validate the bill
with products received in the previous step to ensure accuracy.</li></ol><p >This process may be done by three different people within the company,
or only one.</p></section><section id="configuration"><h2 >配置</h2></section><section id="installing-the-purchase-and-inventory-applications"><h3 >安装采购和库存应用</h3><p >From the <strong >Apps</strong> application, search for the <strong >Purchase</strong> module and
install it. Due to certain dependencies, Installing Purchase will
automatically install the <strong >Inventory</strong> and <strong >Accounting</strong> applications.</p></section><section id="creating-products"><h3 >创建产品</h3><p >Creating products in YuanCloud is essential for quick and efficient
purchasing within YuanCloud. Simply navigate to the Products submenu under
Purchase, and click create.</p><img src="../../../_images/manage01.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><p >When creating the product, Pay attention to the <strong >Product Type</strong> field,
as it is important:</p><ul ><li >Products that are set as <strong >Stockable or Consumable</strong> will allow you
to keep track of their inventory levels. These options imply
stock management and will allow for receiving these kinds of
products.</li><li >Conversely, products that are set as a <strong >Service or Digital Product</strong>
will not imply stock management, simply due to the fact that
there is no inventory to manage. You will not be able to receive
products under either of these designations.</li></ul><div role="alert" class="alert-info alert"><p class="alert-title">小技巧</p><p >It is recommended that you create a <strong >Miscellaneous</strong> product for all purchases
that occur infrequently and do not require inventory valuation or management.
If you create such a product, it is recommend to set the product type to <strong >Service</strong>.</p></div></section><section id="managing-your-vendor-bills"><h2 >管理你的供应商账单</h2></section><section id="purchasing-products-or-services"><h3 >采购产品或服务</h3><p >From the purchase application, you can create a purchase order with as
many products as you need. If the vendor sends you a confirmation or
quotation for an order, you may record the order reference number in the
<strong >Vendor Reference</strong> field. This will enable you to easily match the PO
with the the vendor bill later (as the vendor bill will probably include
the Vendor Reference)</p><img src="../../../_images/manage02.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><p >Validate the purchase order and receive the products from the Inventory
application.</p></section><section id="receiving-products"><h3 >接收产品</h3><p >If you purchased any stockable products that you manage the inventory
of, you will need to receive the products from the Inventory application
after you confirm a Purchase Order. From the <strong >Inventory dashboard</strong>, you
should see a button linking you directly to the transfer of products.
This button is outlined in red below:</p><img src="../../../_images/manage03.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><p >Navigating this route will take you to a list of all orders awaiting to
be received.</p><img src="../../../_images/manage04.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><p >If you have a lot of awaiting orders, apply a filter using the search
bar in the upper right. With this search bar, you may filter based on
the Vendor (Partner), the product, or the source document, also known as
the reference of your purchase order. You also have the capability to
group the orders by different criteria under <strong >Group By</strong>. Selecting an
item from this list will open the following screen where you then will
receive the products.</p><img src="../../../_images/manage05.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><p >Purchasing service products does not trigger a delivery order.</p></section><section id="managing-vendor-bills"><h3 >管理供应商账单</h3><p >When you receive a Vendor Bill for a previous purchase, be sure to
record it in the Purchases application under the <strong >Control Menu</strong>. You
need to create a new vendor bill even if you already registered a
purchase order.</p><img src="../../../_images/manage06.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><p >The first thing you will need to do upon creating a Vendor Bill is to
select the appropriate Vendor as this will also pull up any associated
accounting or pricelist information. From there, you can choose to
specify any one or multiple Purchase Orders to populate the Vendor Bill
with. When you select a Purchase Order from the list, YuanCloud will pull any
uninvoiced products associated to that Purchase Order and automatically
populate that information below. If you are having a hard time finding
the appropriate Vendor bill, you may search through the list by
inputting the vendor reference number or your internal purchase order
number.</p><img src="../../../_images/manage07.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><p >While the invoice is in draft state, you can make any modifications you
need (i.e. remove or add product lines, modify quantities, and change
prices).</p><div role="alert" class="alert-info alert"><p class="alert-title">注解</p><p >Your vendor may send you several bills for the same Purchase Order if:</p><ol ><li >Your vendor is in back-order and is sending you invoices as they ship the products.</li><li >Your vendor is sending you a partial bill or asking for a deposit.</li></ol></div><p >Every time you record a new vendor bill, YuanCloud will automatically
populate the product quantities based on what has been received from the
vendor. If this value is showing a zero, this means that you have not
yet received this product and simply serves as a reminder that the
product is not in hand and you may need to inquire further into this. At
any point in time, before you validate the Vendor Bill, you may override
this zero quantity.</p></section><section id="vendor-bill-matching"><h2 >供应商账单匹配</h2></section><section id="what-to-do-if-your-vendor-bill-does-not-match-what-you-received"><h3 >What to do if your vendor bill does not match what you received</h3><p >If the bill you receive from the vendor has different quantities than
what YuanCloud automatically populates as quantities, this could be due to
several reasons:</p><ul ><li >the vendor is incorrectly charging you for products and/or services
that you have not ordered,</li><li >the vendor is billing you for products that you might not have
received yet, as the invoicing control may be based on ordered or
received quantities,</li><li >or the vendor did not bill you for previously purchased products.</li></ul><p >In these instances it is recommended that you verify that the bill, and
any associated purchase order to the vendor, are accurate and that you
understand what you have ordered and what you have already received.</p><p >If you are unable to find a purchase order related to a vendor bill,
this could be due to one of a few reasons:</p><ul ><li >the vendor has already invoiced you for this purchase order,
therefore it is not going to appear anywhere in the selection,</li><li >someone in the company forgot to record a purchase order for this
vendor,</li><li >or the vendor is charging you for something you did not order.</li></ul></section><section id="how-product-quantities-are-managed"><h3 >How product quantities are managed</h3><p >By default, services are managed based on ordered quantities, while
stockables and consumables are managed based on received quantities.</p><p >If you need to manage products based on ordered quantities over received
quantities, you will need to belong to the group <strong >Purchase Manager</strong>.
Ask your system administrator to enable these access on <span class="menuselection">Settings
‣ Users ‣ Users ‣ Access Rights</span>. Once you belong to the correct group,
select the product(s) you wish to modify, and you should see a new field appear,
labeled <strong >Control Purchase Bills</strong>.</p><img src="../../../_images/manage08.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><p >You can then change the default management method for the selected
product to be based on either:</p><ul ><li >Ordered quantities</li><li >or Received quantities</li></ul></section><section id="batch-billing"><h3 >Batch Billing</h3><p >When creating a vendor bill and selecting the appropriate purchase
order, you may continue to select additional purchase orders and YuanCloud
will add the additional line items from that purchase order.. If you
have not deleted the previous line items from the first purchase order
the bill will be linked to all the appropriate purchase orders.</p></section>

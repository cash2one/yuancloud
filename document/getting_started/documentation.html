<strong >implementation methodology</strong>, and <em >best practices</em> to <strong >get started</strong>
with our product.</p><p ><em >We recommend that new YuanCloud Online customers read this document before
the kick-off call with our project manager. This way, we save time and
don't have to use your hours from the success pack discussing the
basics.</em></p><p ><em >If you have not read this document, our project manager will review
this with you at the time of the kick-off call.</em></p></section><section id="getting-started"><h2 >开始</h2><p >Do not wait for the kick-off meeting to begin playing with the software.
The more exposure you have with YuanCloud, the more time you will save later
during the implementation.</p><p >Once you purchase an YuanCloud Online subscription, you will receive
instructions by e-mail on how to activate or create your database. From
this email, you can activate your existing YuanCloud database or create a new
one from scratch.</p><p >If you did not receive this email, e.g. because the payment was made by
someone else in your company, send an e-mail to
<a href="mailto:online@yuancloud.com" class="external reference">help@yuancloud.com</a>.</p><img src="../_images/getting_started02.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><p >Fill in the sign-in or sign-up screens and you will get your first YuanCloud
database ready to be used. <strong >Don't be afraid of messing up the data</strong>,
it's very easy to duplicate your database, clean it or start a new one.</p><p >In order to familiarize yourself with the user interface, take a few
minutes to create records: <em >products, customers, opportunities or
projects / tasks</em>. Follow the blinking dots, they give you tips about
the user interface as shown in the picture below.</p><table class="table"><tbody ><tr ><td ><img src="../_images/getting_started03.png" alt="left_pic" class="img-responsive"></td><td ><img src="../_images/getting_started04.png" alt="right_pic" class="img-responsive"></td></tr></tbody></table><p >Once you get used to the user interface, have a look at the
implementation planners. These are accessible from the Settings app, or
from the top progress bar on the right hand side of the main
applications.</p><img src="../_images/getting_started05.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><p >These implementation planners will:</p><ul ><li >help you define your goals and KPIs for each application,</li><li >guide you through the different configuration steps,</li><li >and provide you with tips and tricks to getting the most out of YuanCloud.</li></ul><p >Fill in the first steps of the implementation planner (goals,
expectations and KPIs). Our project manager will review them with you
during the implementation process.</p><img src="../_images/getting_started06.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><p >If you have questions or need support, our project manager will guide
you through all the steps. But you can also:</p><ul ><li >Read the documentation on our website:

services, which is much faster than any other ERP vendor on the market.
Most projects are completed between 1 and 4 calendar months.</p><p >But what really <strong >differentiates between a successful implementation and
a slow one, is you, the customer!</strong> From our experience, here is what
leads to a successful project.</p></section><section id="your-internal-implementation-manager"><h3 >提供一个接洽负责人</h3><p >We will ask you for a single point of contact within your company work
on the project with our project manager. To be efficient, this person
must:</p><ul ><li ><strong >be available at least 2 full days a week</strong> for the project,
otherwise you will slow down the implementation. More is better,
the fastest implementations have a full time project manager.</li><li ><strong >have authority to take decisions</strong> on their own. YuanCloud usually
transforms all departments of companies for the better. In such a
project, you have a lot of decisions to take on small details. If
there is too much back and forth between several decision makers,
it could potentially seriously slow things down.</li><li ><strong >have the leadership</strong> to train and enforce policies at most
departments. This person must have the support, or be part, of
the top management.</li></ul></section><section id="integrate-95-of-your-business-not-100"><h3 >满足您的95%需求，不能完全满足您的所有需求</h3><p >You probably chose YuanCloud because no other software allows for such a high
level of automation, feature coverage and integration. But <strong >don't be an
extremist in that direction.</strong></p><p >Customizations cost you money, are more complex to maintain, add risks
to the implementation and can cause issues with upgrades.</p><p >Standard YuanCloud can probably cover 95% of your business. Be flexible on
the remaining 5%, otherwise that 5% will cost you twice the original
project price. One always underestimates the hidden costs of
customization.</p><ul ><li ><strong >Do it the YuanCloud way, not yours.</strong> Be flexible, use YuanCloud the way it
was designed. Learn how it works and don't try to replicate the
way your old system(s) works.</li><li ><strong >The project first, customizations second.</strong> If you really want
customizations, phase them in at the end of the project, ideally
after going into production. Once a customer starts using YuanCloud,
they usually drop about 60% of their customization requests as
they learn to do it the out of the box YuanCloud way. It is more
important to have all your business processes working than
customizing a screen to add fields or automate a few e-mails.</li></ul><p >Our project managers are trained to help you make the right decision and
measure the tradeoffs involved but it is much easier if you are aligned
with them on the objectives.</p></section><section id="invest-time-in-learning-yuancloud"><h3 >学习 YUANCLOUD 时间耗用</h3><p >Start your free trial. Play with the system. The more comfortable you
are with YuanCloud, the better your decisions will be and the training phase
will be that much easier.</p><p >Nothing replaces playing with the software, but here are some extra

phasing of the implementation (road map), mapping of your
business needs and the YuanCloud features.</li><li ><strong >Customized Support:</strong> by phone, e-mail or webinar.</li><li ><strong >Training, Coaching, and Onsite Consulting:</strong> remote trainings via

YuanCloud and advanced configuration. (e.g. logistic routes, advanced
pricing structures, etc.)</li><li ><strong >Data Import</strong>: we can do it or assist you on how to do it with a

customers in production in a short period of time and at a low cost.</p><p >After the kick-off meeting, we define a phasing plan to deploy YuanCloud
progressively, by groups of apps.</p><img src="../_images/getting_started09.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><p >The goal of the <strong >Kick-off call</strong> is, for our project manager, to come
to an understanding of your business in order to propose an
implementation plan (phasing). Each phase is the deployment of a set
applications that you will fully use in production at the end of the
phase.</p><p >For every phase, the steps are the following:</p><ol ><li ><strong >On Boarding:</strong> YuanCloud's project manager will review YuanCloud's business
flows with you, according to your business. The goal is to train
you, validate the business process and configure according to
your specific needs.</li><li ><strong >Data:</strong> are created manually or imported from your existing system.
You are responsible to export the data from your existing system
and YuanCloud's project manager will import them in YuanCloud.</li><li ><strong >Training:</strong> once the applications are set up and the data imported,
you have to train your users on the environment that is perfectly
working. There will be some back and forth with YuanCloud's project
manager to answer questions and process your feedback. (*)</li><li ><strong >Production</strong>: Once everyone is trained, your users start using
YuanCloud.</li></ol><p >(*) <em >Before the training, our project manager will have done the
customizations that are required to go into production. If you can use
the software without these customizations (even if it requires extra
manual tasks), we will push these customizations after going into
production (see phase below).</em></p><p >Once you are comfortable using YuanCloud, we will fine-tune the process and
<strong >automate</strong> some tasks and do the remaining customizations (<strong >extra
screens and reports</strong>).</p><p >Once all applications are deployed and users are comfortable on YuanCloud,
our project manager will not work on your project anymore (unless you
have new needs) and you will use the support service if you have further
questions.</p></section><section id="managing-your-databases"><h2 >Managing your databases</h2><p >To access your databases, go to YuanCloud.com, sign in and click <strong >My
